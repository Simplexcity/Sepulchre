# Sepulchre
'For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams'

Archaology exploration game:
Player always awakens in the graveyard under the tree near the Sepulchre of his fallen comrades.
He hunts ancient artifacts left by the old ones, mayhaps even discovering screaming skull technology.
All while collecting and growing crystals to power his camp.

The deeper he explores, the more the eldrich horrors become aware and things become deathly.
